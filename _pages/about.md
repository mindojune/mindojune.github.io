Hello, I am Do June Min, currently a first year PhD student at the University of Michigan studying computer science. 
My research focus is in natural language processing and computational linguistics. 
I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics from Swarthmore College. 
After that, I earned a master's degree in computer science here at the University of Michigan.

My current research focus is understanding medical conversations and mental health counseling interactions using NLP.
Although we have some idea as to what constitutes "good" communication strategy when it comes to care provider-patient
or therapist-client communication, it is not easy to empirically verify and compare different frameworks and guidelines.
My goal is to understand how participants interact in medical or counseling conversations and how this affects the outcome, 
in terms of clinical or therapy outcome or patient satisfaction.
This will lead to development of counseling strategies based on insights and observations learned from past data.
As part of this effort, I am studying how NLP can be applied to quantify the goal-orientedness of counseling strategy.
The basic idea behind this is that it is important for counselors to find the balance between progressing the therapy and sympathizing/affirming
with the patients.
How can we quantify this behavior?
This is the question I am working on right now.

Some other versions of my first name are: Dojune, Do-june, DJ, and the Doj. 

My interests include:
- Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning
- Linguistics / Computational Linguistics
- Philosophy of Language
