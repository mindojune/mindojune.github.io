Hello, I’m Do June Min, a fifth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics.

I completed my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at Swarthmore College, followed by a master’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Michigan.

My research focuses on understanding medical and mental health conversations using NLP techniques. While there are existing guidelines on effective communication strategies for care providers and therapists, empirically validating these frameworks remains a challenge. My goal is to analyze how participants engage in medical or counseling dialogues and how these interactions influence clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction.

In addition to my work in NLP for conversations, I am also interested in improving human-machine interaction interfaces. This includes my work on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), where I evaluated ASR systems, developed adaptive endpointing strategies, and conducted research with AWS on spoken content retrieval. I’ve also explored Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems, focusing on workflow-guided approaches to improve user interactions with machines.
